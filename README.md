# Introduction
Many people attempt to memorize the Quran and want to challenge themselves, but they encounter a problem in that they are unsure of how or what to do to accomplish so.

## Problem statement :
Many people find it difficult to test their memory when they don't have a partner or teacher to do so. To solve this problem, our Quran application developed a new random function that will choose one Quranic verse at random from any surah. Users can also use this function to design games in which they must finish the surah.

## Objective :
1. To create and implement a web application for the Quran.
2. To make the website for the Quran more thorough.
3. To give people a variety of ways to use the Quran website.
4. To make learning the Quran easier for users.
5. To aid users in strengthening their memory
 
 ## Software requirement :
 Software | Version
 -----|-----|
 PHP | 8.1 |
 Laravel | 8.0 |
 VS code | 1.72.0 |
 
## Coding of random function :
*To get a random page and random buttons, enter this code*

## Random function page :
*To view the results of the Quranic verses, click "สุ่ม" button*

## Results :
A use case diagram is a visual representation of how users interact with the various systems that make up a larger system. The main goal of designing a use case
diagram is to fully describe the system's functionality and to solicit user requests. This is regarded as where system analysis and design should begin.

## Activity Diagram :
Activity diagrams are a method for describing work flow, business processes, and procedural logic. They serve a similar purpose to flowcharts in many aspects, but the main distinction between the two is that they permit parallel behavior.

The user will request a random page and the system will fetch a random page and send back, Then the user will click at the สุ่ม button and the system will fetch a random verses for the user

## Data flow diadram :
A data flow diagram demonstrates the path that information takes through a system or process. It contains the numerous subprocesses the data flows through, data inputs and outputs, and data stores.

The user will request a random verses from a random management, Then the random management will fetch a random verses from a database which stored a verses, Then send back to the random management and to the user.

## User interface :

## Conclusion :
This Quran program can aid users in memorizing the Quran, and we anticipate that our new random function will be beneficial to all users.
Therefore, we sincerely hope that everyone who used our Quran application was satisfied with it.
